+4

This is "The Road not Taken" by Robert Frost

```
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oe, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I think there was a mistake in the puzzle or I transcribed something wrong.

`corvus oculum corvi non eruit` is latin for
`a raven will not pick out an eye of another raven`
